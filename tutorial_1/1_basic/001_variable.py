# variable = a container for a value. behaves as the value that it contains
#           Python does not care what the name of the variable is, it just uses the variable

# string
name = "Bro"
print("Hello " + name)

# string
first_name = "Bro"
last_name = "Code"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print("Hello " + full_name)
print(type(full_name))

# integer
age = 21
print(age)
print(type(age))

# float
height = 250.5
print(height)
print(type(height))

# boolean
human = True
print(human)
print(type(human))
